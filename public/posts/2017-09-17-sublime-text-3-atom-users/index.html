  <h1>Sublime Text 3 for Atom Users</h1>
  <time datetime=2017-09-17T15:06:13Z class="post-date">Sun, Sep 17, 2017</time>
  <p>Due to the release of Sublime Text 3, I thought I&rsquo;ll give this editor a shot. Currently, I&rsquo;m using both Notepad++ and Atom. Altough I really like atom and the several useful plugins, it has one huge problem: speed. The initial loading time is one thing, over 100 mb. of RAM in idle mode is another. For quickly editing stuff, this is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Sublime Text seems to be a nice alternative, this article documents my switch from Atom to Sublime Text.</p>
<h2 id="download-and-installation">Download and Installation</h2>
<p>As opposed to Atom, Sublime Text is not free. The per-user-licenses are $80 each, which I think is a very price for a tool, that you work with each day.</p>
<p>Also, I think the most users are developers themselves and share the same mindset of willing to pay for good software.</p>
<h2 id="plugins-and-themes">Plugins and Themes</h2>
<p>You can use plugins and themes in Sublime as well as you&rsquo;re used to in Atom. The easiest way to do this is to install package control (<em>Tools</em> - <em>Install package control</em>, <a href="https://packagecontrol.io">https://packagecontrol.io</a>). After that, you can use it via CTRL + SHIFT + P. Enter <em>install</em>, and it will autocomplete to <em>Package Control: Install Package</em>. After that, you can install whatever package you like.</p>
<p>One of the things I really liked the most on Atom is the built-in markdown preview. Another option I really enjoyed while using atom is the infinite scrolling mode, which is automatically enabled in Sublime Text. I quickly found alternatives for all of my favourite plugins. The installation of themes is easy as well. You&rsquo;ll first install whatever package you like, and the activate it by using the CTRL + SHIFT + P shortcut. A theme I really like for Sublime is <a href="https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme">Brogrammer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;d like to mention here are the file based user settings. Under <em>Preferences</em> - <em>Settings</em>, you can add your customized settings for an individual look &amp; feel. Any config-element is also listed in the default settings, displayed on the right, from where you can copy and edit the specific items. For example, I set my default font to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono">Fira Mono</a>.</p>
