      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Zwift pretty extensively for the last few months. For anyone unfamiliar: Zwift is a VR Biking platform. That means, you can put your bike on a smarttrainer, connect it to your pc (directly via ant+ / ble or by bridging with your phone), and then you can ride virtual worlds without having to go outside. Sounds not too bad, right?
After a few sessions, just riding became kind of tedious, so I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do some of the preconfigured workouts.</description>
