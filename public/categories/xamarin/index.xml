      <description>Today I would like to introduce my current side project. I&amp;rsquo;m currently developing CryptoFolio, an app that allows you to keep track of your investments in cryptocurrencies.
Functionality &amp;amp; MVP The first release of the application will allow you to view the current rates of the top 100 cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization. You can then add investments, where input, output and the date of the transaction is recorded.</description>
