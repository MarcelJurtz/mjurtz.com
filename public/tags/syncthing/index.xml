      <description>Everyone has different programs and tools that they particularly appreciate. One of these programs is syncthing for me, so I will briefly discuss how it works and how it is set up in this article.

I personally use it on Windows 10,Â Arch Linux and Android (via Playstore or FDroid).</description>
