Hey, today just a short note on a few changes to my website.

Basically I planned to take up various topics in the area of software development and to capture my thoughts on this blog. However, as you may have noticed, I have published a lot about other subjects lately. I want to return to my roots on this site, so I decided to set up a separate blog. From now on you will only find posts on software development and related topics on this blog. Sports-related posts will now be posted to mjurtz.com/triblog or triblog.mjurtz.com as soon as I get the subdomain set up correctly.  

Thanks for your attention, regular posts will follow!
