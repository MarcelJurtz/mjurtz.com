<p>This post covers e-mail-encyrption with PGP.</p>
<p>I'll be using Thunderbird as my primary e-mail client, but you can use other clients as well. You'll also need <a href="https://www.gpg4win.de/">gpg4win</a> if you're on windows and the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/">enigmail Thunderbird plugin</a>.</p>
<p>It is useful to first install gpg4win, since enigmail will search for the installation path of GnuPG. You can check this setting and configure it correctly (if needed) in the plugin settings. Now, PGP-keys have to be added. Therefore, you'll have to open your options menu and select the entry <em>manage keys </em>and then <em>generate new key pair</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-369" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/keys-500x408.png" alt="" width="500" height="408" /></p>
<p>And that's basically it! The new key pair contains a public key, that other people can use to encrypt messages, that can only be decrypted by your private key. To make people aware of your key, you can for example upload it (the public one of course) onto your website. You can also send messages and append your key:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-370" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/appending_key-500x193.png" alt="" width="500" height="193" /></p>
<p>When sending e-mails, you'll now be prompted to edit the settings of the recipient. There you can select a public key which matches the recipient. This will cause automatic encryption for all future communication with this person.</p>
