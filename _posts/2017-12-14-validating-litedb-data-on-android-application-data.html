    it is quite useful to inspect the local data. This article shows you how to do
    this with ADB.

<p>In my new sideproject CryptoFolio, which I announced in <a href="https://blog.mjurtz.com/2017/12/sideproject-cryptofolio/">this article</a>, I described that I'd like to use LiteDB to locally store data that I received from the coinmarketcap-API. LiteDB is basically a NoSQL database, in particular a document store. It functions on a serverless file basis and can be accessed via a simple API.</p>
<p>While it is quite easy to implement the databases functionality itself, testing the resulting data structure is somewhat more difficult. But to be sure that my data is saved correctly, I needed a way to explore the database located on the android device. Therefore, I use the following approach:</p>
<p>I start by downloading <a href="https://github.com/JosefNemec/LiteDbExplorer">LiteDB Explorer</a>, a free tool to visually inspect LiteDB database files. However, to view such a file, I need access to it first.</p>
<p>You can do this by using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). After enabling the developer options on your device, you can use the command <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">adb backup -noapk com.your.packagename</code> to copy your applications data from the smartphone to the pc. Note that you can use <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">adb restore backup.db</code> to go the opposite way, which can be useful for restoring application backups.</p>
<p>After entering the command, you'll have to confirm the operation on the device.  The backup will be copied to your home directory per default. As a result of this operation, you will receive an .ab-file. I recommend using ADB Backup Extractor, which you can download from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/adbextractor/files/latest/download">SourceForge</a> for free. This tool converts the .ab-file to a regular .tar-file, which can easily be extracted using a tool like 7-Zip.</p>
<p>Use this command to convert your ab file:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">java -jar abe.jar [-debug] [-useenv=yourenv] unpack &lt;backup.ab&gt; &lt;backup.tar&gt; [password]</pre>
<p>Among the unzipped files you will now find the database file. Use the previously mentioned explorer to visualize it.</p>
