      <description>Gold medal at the Olympics, world record holder at the 70.3 World Championships in Roth and a world champion title at the Ironman in Kona - Jan Frodeno is a name that certainly does not only ring a bell for triathlon enthusiasts. Frodeno is celebrated by the fans like no other. But who is the athlete?

      <description>In his biography Frank Thelen describes the various aspects of his life. From childhood, skating, the first company foundation and private debts in the millions to successful exits, everything is included. In this article you will find a summary of some important points of the book, but for more details I suggest you take a look at the book, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth the time.
In Germany, Thelen is certainly best known for the TV show &amp;ldquo;The Lion&amp;rsquo;s Cave&amp;rdquo;, but from an entrepreneurial point of view, he&amp;rsquo;s already done a lot.</description>
