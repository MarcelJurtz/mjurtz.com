<p>Aaand another sideproject getting started. This one will handle the reservations of my local squash court, which are currently made in person or by phone. I'll be building a php web app to manage the reservations online.</p>
<p>To be able to adapt this tool in other clubs, I'd like to be able to customize the amount of courts available and the length of an interval, which is 30 minutes for me. Users should be able to check online which intervals are available and reserve specific times. I don't want them to sign up, but I'll need some kind of spam protection. Therefore, I decided that a confirmation of reservations should be required. So, after a user reserves a court, the administrator will have to confirm the reservation. This should be deactivatable. Personal reservations should be possible as well, which then will be made directly by the administrator.</p>
