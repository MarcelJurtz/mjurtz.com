However, this subdomain was already in use for all my coding-related stuff. So, I decided to move my current blog from /blog to /coding and upload my new blog to /blog. So far, so good. Now I have both of my blogs up and running. There&rsquo;s just one problem: Any incoming traffic to existing posts on my blog would resolve to 404s.

FluentValidation FluentValidation is a way to define strongly typed validation for classes in the form of a Fluent API. The term fluent in this case refers to a code structure where a function always return the modified object.

For anyone unfamiliar: Zwift is a VR Biking platform. That means, you can put your bike on a smarttrainer, connect it to your pc (directly via ant+ / ble or by bridging with your phone), and then you can ride virtual worlds without having to go outside. Sounds not too bad, right?
After a few sessions, just riding became kind of tedious, so I&rsquo;ve tried to do some of the preconfigured workouts.

I don&rsquo;t really have an excuse for my absence but I&rsquo;ve been kind of busy, both personally and professionally. But I&rsquo;m planning to post on here more frequently from now on.
As always, trying something new in software development helps to become motivated and excited. In the last months, I&rsquo;ve been using Jekyll as a static site generator to build this site. Though I enjoyed using Jekyll, I never really got into the Ruby environment and have been looking for something more familiar.

Well, the tool doesn&rsquo;t offer explicit ER modeling, but a SQL-like structure and allows you to import and export directly to SQL and other formats.
You can find the app I&rsquo;m talking about on dbdiagram.io. The website offers a simple graphical interface, which includes a code editor and a graphical representation of the table structure.

You certainly know the concept of being able to explain things to others in order to better understand them yourself. That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m doing with my blog and that&rsquo;s also the goal of the Feynman technique.

        <time datetime=" 2019-01-13T06:00:00Z " class="post-date">Sun, Jan 13, 2019</time> The partial keyword in C# allows you to spread a class definition across multiple files. You&rsquo;ve probably seen this before when you created a WinForms application and viewed the MyForm.Designer.cs file, which contains the properties you define in the Designer. So the Visual Designer stores the entire definition of your user interface in this separate file. The class of your form itself is always marked partial. Files of partial methods must not be in different assemblies and will be merged during compilation.

One of them is Electron, a cross-platform desktop solution used for the Atom editor. Microsoft also uses Electron for Visual Studio Code.
Electron runs with NodeJS, so applications for it are usually written in JavaScript. For .NET developers there is now Electron.NET available, an Electron wrapper for ASP.NET Core applications.
An Electron.NET application hosts the ASP.

Today I want to go a little deeper into what attributes are, what kind of them are already present in the .NET framework, and how you can define your own attributes.
Microsoft defines attributes as a powerful way to associate metadata or descriptive information with code. But what exactly does that mean?
Classes have, among other characteristics, fields, methods, properties, but also a state and behavior.

Basically I planned to take up various topics in the area of software development and to capture my thoughts on this blog. However, as you may have noticed, I have published a lot about other subjects lately. I want to return to my roots on this site, so I decided to set up a separate blog.

But when exactly is code actually to be considered clean? Today I&rsquo;d like to give you a brief overview of how you can assess and improve your code quality. I should perhaps note that writing good code, and therefore this article, is independent of the programming language used and is rather methodical in nature. However, for more detailed information, I recommend that you really get a book on the subject.

        <time datetime=" 2018-12-09T06:00:00Z " class="post-date">Sun, Dec 9, 2018</time> Writing down your goals is extremely helpful for really achieving them. With fixed, terminable goals with fixed intermediate steps, you make it much easier for yourself to really achieve your self-imposed goals.
Today I would like to show you a way to define your goals with the help of the so-called &ldquo;Impossible List&rdquo;. At first glance this list looks like an Impossible List, but it is definitely not: Joel Runyon, the author of the first Impossible List describes the classic Bucket List as a static list that was written at some point in life and usually none of the points written down really affect the life of the creator.

        <time datetime=" 2018-12-02T06:00:00Z " class="post-date">Sun, Dec 2, 2018</time> I have been asked all too often which programming language to learn first. And I&rsquo;ve heard almost the same number of different opinions. Java or C++? Python or C#? Or maybe C?
High-level programming languages like Java offer the big advantage that the entry hurdle is very low. You can quickly put together a functional application that does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. The extensive ecosystem allows you to make rapid progress and concentrate on the functionality of your software.

Frodeno is celebrated by the fans like no other. But who is the athlete? Today I&rsquo;m reviewing his book &ldquo;Winning Matters - Success through courage and passion&rdquo; and try to find an answer to this question.

In this article you will find a summary of some important points of the book, but for more details I suggest you take a look at the book, it&rsquo;s definitely worth the time.
In Germany, Thelen is certainly best known for the TV show &ldquo;The Lion&rsquo;s Cave&rdquo;, but from an entrepreneurial point of view, he&rsquo;s already done a lot.

As you may know, skyboxes are usually created from 6 images (cubemaps), with each image representing one of the sides. However, 360° photos usually use a so-called &ldquo;Equirectangular&rdquo; format, which looks something like this:

So in order to be able to use such an image in Unity, the idea of creating a cubemap from a 360° photo is obvious.

.NET Core is an alternative to the classic .NET Framework. In contrast to the .NET Framework, .NET Core offers a huge advantage: It is platform-independent and therefore compatible with MacOS, Linux and Windows.
The purpose of this article is to build a small REST-based API, which will respond to HTTP GET-requests. Of course you can extend the project according to your own ideas and experiment around.

Garbage Collection in General I want to start with some general theory - what is garbage collection and what do I need it for? Garbage collection (GC) is basically a feature that relieves developers of the work of allocating and deallocating memory for their objects.

The basic idea of an MVP is to make a version of a product available to the customer as quickly as possible. The goal is not to generate sales, but to learn. Of course it&rsquo;s not a bad idea and it&rsquo;s also the intention to earn money with your product, but the idea here is to put yourself in the customer&rsquo;s shoes and better understand their needs and requirements.

By the time your side projects take on larger dimensions or you work in a team, you will be confronted with the topic of version control.
Version control is basically the management of source code, so that several developers can work on the same files at the same time.

        <time datetime=" 2018-06-18T06:00:00Z " class="post-date">Mon, Jun 18, 2018</time> In todays post I want to show you how to use attributes in C#. I have to apologize in advance, though, as I&rsquo;m going to focus only to a limited extent on why they make sense and what you can use them for, that&rsquo;s a topic for one of the following articles. Nevertheless, I would like to give you a basic understanding so that you can incorporate this concept into your own applications.

But now to the topic: As a software developer you can hardly avoid acquiring basic knowledge in web development. Specifically, I mean the handling of HTML and CSS, also in JavaScript as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. If you are like me, you basically have no problems with it, but CSS files will become quite confusing and difficult to revise over time.

ClubGrid was originally designed to make it easier for my coach to manage our baseball games. However, the result can be used for clubs of any kind and I hope that I can also help others with my software.
The problem we had was the organization of games and events. Some players posted their acceptance or rejection via Whatsapp, others via Facebook, some via email and others personally.

Today I would like to show you how I have taken such a step and what has changed since then.

Nevertheless, most of them overlap in the description and cause confusion among developers. For this reason I decided to write my own article to document my opinion.
In this article I will first clarify the what and why of the repository pattern. Afterwards I will explain how the pattern can look like in C#.
In his book, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, Martin Fowler describes the Repository Pattern as a “Mediate between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory collection of domain objects”.

Todays article covers the basics of this topic and helps you to get comfortable implementing this approach in your own applications.
Delegates I think, the main problem is that delegates are often explained unnecessarily complicated. For this reason, I want to give you an easily understandable introduction. Let&rsquo;s look at a basic delegate declaration:

Since Jekyll is a static site generator and does not rely on a database for the posts, you can&rsquo;t simply add a search functionality like WordPress does. So, I have to work with some frontend / clientside stuff.

Some days ago, I&rsquo;ve been looking for an app which allowed my to keep track of shopping lists in a simple and fast way. While there are lots of such apps available for Android, all I tested seemed to be overkill for what I really wanted. So I decided to create my own app for this purpose.
Besides creating a simple app, my goal was to learn something new while developing the app.

A tiling window manager divides the screen into non-overlapping areas. You are probably more used to a stack-based system where windows can overlap. However, the concept of avoiding overlapping offers a major advantage: Due to the pure operation of the computer via keyboard, it is possible to work at a faster pace after a short training period.

Android now offers an alternative, which aims to increase performance by only loading those elements, that are currently rendered on-screen: the RecyclerView.
This article shows you how to get started with the RecyclerView. To make things a bit more interesting, we will be using Kotlin instead of Java.
You can set up an Android project for Kotlin by simply clicking the checkbox for Kotlin support in the new project wizard.

However, often times you&rsquo;ll see this port being blocked on public WIFI networks. On a Linux machine, there is a simple way to change the default port.
To test if our plan works out, you can use the following command:
bash &gt;ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
This will test the ssh connection by using port 443. If this returns a positive result, you can change the port in your ssh config file.

Redefining Operators
 To create custom functionality for operators in combination with your own classes, you&rsquo;ll simply need to create methods matching a specific pattern. These methods require the usage of the keyword operator, followed by the actual operator you&rsquo;ll want to overwrite.

Installation Prerequisites As I said you need to run Wine. As stated on their landing page, Wine is a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run under POSIX-compliant operating systems such as Linux, macOS and BSD.

While this feature definitely is useful, it would sometimes be more practical if you could do this over WIFI instead.
Luckily, that is possible! You can simple switch between using USB and TCP/IP for debugging. To get started, you need to connect your device via USB to the computer you&rsquo;re debugging from. I&rsquo;m using Windows, so the commands I&rsquo;ll execute the following commands from the commandline (which runs as an administrator), but since they are adb commands, they should be the same on Linux or macOS.

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) allows you to encrypt and digitally sign your emails. I wanted to publish this post for quite some time now and thanks to some help from the 34C3, I finally managed to do it.
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Before we can start installing all the requirements and setting up PGP, I&rsquo;d like to give you a short introduction to PGP.

Null-Conditional Operator You can use the null-conditional operator to prevent _NullReferenceException_s. The basic principle of the operator is to return a value if it is not null, and return null if it is. The following code shows you how to use the operator, which is initiated by a question mark, followed by a dot.

Octoprint basically provides a webinterface for 3D-printers, which allows you to send tasks over your local network to the printer and to monitor the prints. The software also provides a plugin functionality, so you can create your custom addons if required.
Note that you can use Octoprint for slicing, but in my case I will be starting of with only sending pre sliced stl files to print.

You can use extension methods to add custom functionality to classes that are built by others. In my very case, I&rsquo;d like to extend the functionality of the String class to set its first letter to upper case. I already implemented this functionality in my sideproject CryptoFolio, be sure to check out my article on the topic!

Collections support several different use cases, e. g. searching through a set for objects with certain properties, or iterating through multiple elements by predefined sorting specifications.
In the first part of this article, I will cover the two basic types of collections in C#, lists and dictionaries.

For example, these directives allow you to execute certain code elements only under predefined conditions. Another possible field of use is simply the structuring of your source code into blocks, which can be folded in and out of Visual Studio.
In this article I will discuss some of these directives. Preprocessor directives are always started with a #-symbol.

However, there is an easy way to recycle defined styles and use them for other controls, often saving a lot of code. So, styles basically allow you to move your repeatedly used styles out of the layout file into a styles.xml file (which is located in the values-folder). This article covers the basics of using styles on Android.
Think of the following layout, which represents two simple buttons inside a LinearLayout:

        <time datetime=" 2017-11-12T10:05:27Z " class="post-date">Sun, Nov 12, 2017</time> As a software developer, you&rsquo;ve probably stumbled across old source code you&rsquo;ve written from time to time and you&rsquo;ve just been thinking &lsquo;how the hell can someone come up with such bullshit?&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t see myself as an exception regarding this topic and just recently had such a case, which I would like to document in this article. More specifically, I want to discuss the decoupling of views under xamarin. The source I use in this article is available on my GitHub profile.

One of these programs is syncthing for me, so I will briefly discuss how it works and how it is set up in this article. Syncthing is used to synchronize files between different devices and also supports versioning of these files. Syncthing is available for Windows, Android and as cross-platform wrapper. I personally use it on Windows 10, Arch Linux and Android (via Playstore or FDroid).

While it is often very easy to find the motivation to start a new project, many of them end up unfinished or not in a way you would like them to.
Laying Focus As you can see on GitHub, I don&rsquo;t see myself as an exception, where I&rsquo;ve started a lot of projects, but only a few end up finished.

As a software developer it is almost self-evident to work on various own side projects, which in my case are currently mostly developed in the form of Android apps. Starting with an originally simple LifeCounter for Magic the Gathering, over smaller games up to the design of websites, my GitHub profile has meanwhile reached a considerable size.

Since a complete switch from Windows to Linux is not feasible for me due to different requirements, I looked for alternatives. An important component of various Linux distributions is their package manager. This article discusses the implementation of such a feature under Windows and shows how it can be used.

Both projects, client and server are located on my GitHub-profile and can be viewed and downloaded there.

Configuration To get started, you&rsquo;ll want to create a new ASP.NET project, and load the ServiceStack package via NuGet. Then, you&rsquo;ll have to edit your Web.config to look like the following (mentioned versions may differ from your project):
&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;utf-8&#34;?&gt; &lt;!

I have to admit that I didn&rsquo;t exactly know what I was getting into. After clicking the received URL, a very minimalistic website is displayed.
So, the service allows you to upload files. I never would have thought of that.

Currently, I&rsquo;m using both Notepad++ and Atom. Altough I really like atom and the several useful plugins, it has one huge problem: speed. The initial loading time is one thing, over 100 mb. of RAM in idle mode is another. For quickly editing stuff, this is not acceptable.
Sublime Text seems to be a nice alternative, this article documents my switch from Atom to Sublime Text.

You could solve this problem by saving the credentials or by setting up ssh for your account. In this post, the process of adding and using ssh keys will be explained.
I&rsquo;m using git bash, if you use git gui/sourcetree/etc. you should consider switching, at least for this process.
At first, SSH keys are generated. The command for this is the following:

The mentioned commands and parameters are only a small part of what&rsquo;s possible. Git is a popular system for version control. Projects on git are called Repositories. Repositories can be used local or with a server. There are several free hosters, for example:
 Github GitLab BitBucket  Installation  Linux (Debian-based)  apt-get install git-all  Windows Mac  Elements Git-Repositories are separated into working directory, staging area and repository.
