      <description>If you are reading this, chances are you already use a password manager. I have been doing that for several years now. But I have to admit that my password manager has only run on my phone so far and I have always transferred passwords that I use on my PC by hand. Probably out of sheer laziness. Today, I use this blog post to finally synchronise my password database between any number of devices - and to show you how to do it.</description>

      <description>Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how you can set up PGP for Thunderbird. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) allows you to encrypt and digitally sign your emails. I wanted to publish this post for quite some time now and thanks to some help from the 34C3, I finally managed to do it.
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Before we can start installing all the requirements and setting up PGP, I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you a short introduction to PGP.</description>
