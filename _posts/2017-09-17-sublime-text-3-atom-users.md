Due to the release of Sublime Text 3, I thought I&#8217;ll give this editor a shot. Currently, I&#8217;m using both Notepad++ and Atom. Altough I really like atom and the several useful plugins, it has one huge problem: speed. The initial loading time is one thing, over 100 mb. of RAM in idle mode is another. For quickly editing stuff, this is not acceptable.

Sublime Text seems to be a nice alternative, this article documents my switch from Atom to Sublime Text.

### Download and Installation

As opposed to Atom, Sublime Text is not free. The per-user-licenses are $80 each, which I think is a very price for a tool, that you work with each day.
  
Also, I think the most users are developers themselves and share the same mindset of willing to pay for good software.

### Plugins and Themes

You can use plugins and themes in Sublime as well as you&#8217;re used to in Atom. The easiest way to do this is to install package control (_Tools_ &#8211; _Install package control_, https://packagecontrol.io). After that, you can use it via CTRL + SHIFT + P. Enter _install_, and it will autocomplete to _Package Control: Install Package_. After that, you can install whatever package you like.

One of the things I really liked the most on Atom is the built-in markdown preview. Another option I really enjoyed while using atom is the infinite scrolling mode, which is automatically enabled in Sublime Text. I quickly found alternatives for all of my favourite plugins. The installation of themes is easy as well. You&#8217;ll first install whatever package you like, and the activate it by using the CTRL + SHIFT + P shortcut. A theme I really like for Sublime is [Brogrammer](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme).

### Settings

The last thing I&#8217;d like to mention here are the file based user settings. Under _Preferences_ &#8211; _Settings_, you can add your customized settings for an individual look & feel. Any config-element is also listed in the default settings, displayed on the right, from where you can copy and edit the specific items. For example, I set my default font to [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono).
