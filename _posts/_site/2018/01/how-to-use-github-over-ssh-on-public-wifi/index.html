<p>When using GitHub via SSH, port 22 will be used per default. However, often times you’ll see this port being blocked on public WIFI networks. On a Linux machine, there is a simple way to change the default port.</p>

<p>To test if our plan works out, you can use the following command:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">&gt;</span>ssh <span class="nt">-T</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> 443 git@ssh.github.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will test the ssh connection by using port 443. If this returns a positive result, you can change the port in your ssh config file.</p>

<p>You can find the SSH configuration in <em>~/.ssh/config</em>. To change the port, open the file and add a new entry for github, which will look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">&gt;</span>Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443</code></pre></figure>

<p>You can use whatever port you’d like. I’m using port 443, which is the default HTTPS port. That is also the one GitHub recommends to use in <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-ssh-over-the-https-port/">their documentation</a>. Save your changes and you will be able to work as you’re used to.</p>
