      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about learning new things more efficiently, i.e. wasting as little time as possible on learning. I use the Feynman technique, named after the physicist Richard Feynman. Feynman was known for his ability to break down complex facts into their core message and to convey them very easily.
You certainly know the concept of being able to explain things to others in order to better understand them yourself. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m doing with my blog and that&amp;rsquo;s also the goal of the Feynman technique.</description>
