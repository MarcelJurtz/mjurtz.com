<p>Android has various options for storing data internally, such as the integrated SQLite database. For testing purposes I created an application with Xamarin which stores data in a local NoSQL database. I use <a href="https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB">LiteDB</a> for this purpose. However, this application became problematic when I tried to fix problems with my data structure. The database is stored in the Android file system, but it is not possible to open this path on a non-rooted device. This article is intended to document my solution, which can also be used for general access to app data.</p>
<p>First of all, ADB is needed, which is included in the Android SDK. A backup can then be created via ADB, provided the device is connected via USB. To create a backup this way, the name of the apps package is needed. To then create the backup, enter the following command: <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">adb backup -noapk com.packackename</code>. This results in an .ab-file (android backup) being created. I then found the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/adbextractor">Android Backup Extractor on Sourceforge</a>, which is able to convert .ab-files to .tar-files, which again can be easily extracted. To convert the backup file, simply use this command: <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">java.exe -jar abe.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar ""</code>, which converts the backup.ab file to backup.tar.</p>
<p>After the extraction there are several files available, including the database file of litedb.</p>
