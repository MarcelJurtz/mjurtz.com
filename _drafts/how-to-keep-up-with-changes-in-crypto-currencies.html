<p>For some time now I have been participating in the cryptocurrency market. However, this participation was rather passive, which has limited me to sizes like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some time ago I started to deal with altcoins, more specifically with IOTA and Bytecoin. Yesterday I decided to invest in IOTA, but for reasons of time I postponed it to today.</p>
<p>Guess what happened.</p>
<p>Right guessed. Fucking shit.</p>
<p>Although I did participate a little bit in the krypto-market (more precisely: bitcoin and ethereum), I did not really have an active involvement. But in order not to miss out on the potential here, I searched through several sources and tried out ways to stay as up-to-date as possible.</p>
<p>I must point out here that I consider two important criteria in my search for information: On the one hand, this is simply a matter of the time required for research. I don't have the time to spend several hours a day reading about what's new and which currency might be affected in what way.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have to say that I (currently) only use this market for speculative purposes. More specifically, while I'm playing with the idea of focusing on the underlying technology and possibly writing my own applications that interact with the IOTA tangle for example, my other side projects are more important to me at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>TL; DR: I am looking for ways to briefly and succinctly inform myself about changes that primarily target the monetary aspect.</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of these constraints comprehensive readings are avoided. For the time being, I have focused on the more popular web portals and subscribed to the newsletter if possible. in this way, I regularly receive up-to-date information without manually collecting it from different sources.</p>
<p>I currently use the following websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.btc-echo.de/">BTC Echo (German)</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>As an alternative to the mentioned websites, I found other channels to be very helpful: Reddit and Twitter, in my opinion, offer much better possibilities for quickly capturing the most important information than individual websites. Twitter may be less meaningful due to the topics influenced by other contactsÂ and thus the possibility to miss certain postings, but reddit is definitely catching up.</p>
<p>Due to the different communities on any topic you could think of (really, try it out), it is hardly possible to miss something important.</p>
