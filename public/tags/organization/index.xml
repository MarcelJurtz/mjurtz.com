      <description>Have you ever wondered what kind of methodology you should use to label the releases of your software? Many projects use a structure with three numbers, each separated by a dot.

      <description>Almost all programming projects work with some kind of version control. When I started to work with Git, I used the tool also directly for my private projects. But especially at the beginning I found it hard to structure my commits and branches in a practical way. For this reason I would like to show you some common strategies today, the so-called Git Workflows.
Simple Workflow The simple workflow consists of a single master branch.</description>
