      <description>Today I would like to introduce my current side project. I&amp;rsquo;m currently developing CryptoFolio, an app that allows you to keep track of your investments in cryptocurrencies.
Functionality &amp;amp; MVP The first release of the application will allow you to view the current rates of the top 100 cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization. You can then add investments, where input, output and the date of the transaction is recorded.</description>

      <description>Besides my series on how to get started with ServiceStack, I have already published a few articles that are related to the topic, but do not belong directly to the introductory series. In the last such article, I used the example of coinmarketcap.com to show how to access third-party APIs using the C# client.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use ServiceStacks Logging API and link it to a slack channel.</description>

      <description>In the first article of my series on using ServiceStack I mentioned the feature of the framework that the individual components can be used independently of each other.
This short article is intended as an example of how the C# client can be used separately from a custom service to communicate with third-party APIs. If you would like to know more about the client specifically, you can read my article on this feature.</description>

      <description>After we covered the basics of ServiceStack in part one and how to set up a service in part two of this series. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll go through how the C#-Client can be utilized to make communication between applications even easier. The sourcecode for todays article is available GitHub. If you missed one of the previous parts, feel free to check out Part 1 - What is ServiceStack and why should I use it?</description>

      <description>This is the second post in my series on building web services with ServiceStack. In the first part, I covered the benefits of using ServiceStack, this article continues with the setup of a basic service and its several components.
In this and the following parts I will create a simple example project to illustrate the use of servicestack. This project will be an expenses tracker. In this part, we will develop the functionality to add expenses and establish an overall balance.</description>

      <description>This article is the beginning of a series of articles in which I want to discuss the basics of building web services and designing REST APIs using ServiceStack. This first article discusses the question of what ServiceStack is all about, the benefits of it, and why you should use (or at least try out) this framework. The following articles will then discuss the design of a simple service by using a simple example to illustrate the various possibilities it offers.</description>

      <title>RESTful Services with ServiceStack - Part 2</title>

      <description>In my last post, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a basic RESTful service using ServiceStack. This article deals with the implementation of a corresponding functionality on the client side. The application will query the path provided by the server and apply the pre-defined authentication method, requiring the user to log in with username and password before the application delivers the desired content.
Both projects, client and server are located on my GitHub-profile and can be viewed and downloaded there.</description>

      <description>This articles covers the basic usage of ServiceStack, a .NET-framework for creating RESTful services. The framework has a really great documentation, where you can check out all the details.
Configuration To get started, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to create a new ASP.NET project, and load the ServiceStack package via NuGet. Then, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to edit your Web.config to look like the following (mentioned versions may differ from your project):
&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; encoding=&amp;#34;utf-8&amp;#34;?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!</description>
