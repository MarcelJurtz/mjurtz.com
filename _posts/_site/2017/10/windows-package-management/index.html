<p>As a Windows user with Linux knowledge there are several things under Linux that I would like to have on for Windows. Since a complete switch from Windows to Linux is not feasible for me due to different requirements, I looked for alternatives. An important component of various Linux distributions is their package manager. This article discusses the implementation of such a feature under Windows and shows how it can be used.</p>

<p>While researching this topic I came across chocolatey, a CLI-tool that acts as package manager for Windows operating systems. Chocolatey is open source, <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey">the code is available on GitHub</a>. On the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">project’s website</a> you will also find instructions for installation, which can be performed using CMD commands or via powershell.</p>

<h2 id="install-update-uninstall">Install, Update, Uninstall</h2>

<p>A list of available packages can be viewed on <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages">https://chocolatey.org/packages</a>. As with the Arch User Repository, packages are managed by users, which means that there is a very large selection of available packages. The pattern for installing packages is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>choco install <packagename>&lt;/code&gt;</packagename></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A full list of commands can be found in <a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs">the docs</a>. Installed packages can be uninstalled using</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>choco uninstall <packagename>&lt;/code&gt;</packagename></p>
</blockquote>

<p>or upgraded by using</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>choco upgrade<packagename>&lt;/code&gt;</packagename></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to upgrade all installed packages, simply use the keyword <em>all</em> instead of a specific packagename.</p>

<p>By default, Chocolatey creates a directory under <em>C: \ProgramData</em> which contains the program files. The installation locations for the individual programs depend on the configuration of the package, but usually either <em>C:\Program Files</em> or <em>C:\Program Files (x86)</em> is used.</p>

<p>Of course, the package management does not only include installation, upgrade and deinstallation of packages, so this section is dedicated to some other features. Check out the docs for a complete list of features.</p>

<p>You can search packages by using</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>choco search <packagename>&lt;/code&gt;</packagename></p>
</blockquote>

<p>which results into something similar to the following listing.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-dos" data-lang="dos">D:\&gt;choco search jenkins
Chocolatey v0.10.8
jenkins 2.60.3 [Approved]
gradle 4.1.0 [Approved] Downloads cached for licensed users
notify-me-ci 1.3.3.13 [Approved] Downloads cached for licensed users
JenkinsOnDesktop 1.0
4 packages found.</code></pre></figure>

<p>To check out the installed version of choco, you can use</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>choco –version&lt;/code&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>choco -v</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To upgrade chocolatey, just use the regular update command. To list all packages available, use</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>choco list</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you only want to receive the packages that are installed locally, add the <em>-l</em> flag.</p>

<p>These few commands should be sufficient to enable you to get started with package management under Windows. As already mentioned, the documentation of the project conveys all further details in a simple and understandable way. And, if you’re not comfortable using the command line, there is also a graphical user interface for chocolatey available, which can be found under the name <em>chocolateygui</em>.</p>
