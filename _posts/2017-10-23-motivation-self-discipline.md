During my participation in various software development projects, I have noticed one thing they usually have in common. While it is often very easy to find the motivation to start a new project, many of them end up unfinished or not in a way you would like them to.

## Laying Focus

As you can see on GitHub, I don&#8217;t see myself as an exception, where I&#8217;ve started a lot of projects, but only a few end up finished. It is generally difficult to define a software project as completed, but that&#8217;s not the point I want to describe in this article. Therefore, i&#8217;m only interested in having a functioning MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in place.

But why is that? In my case, I often have the problem of easily getting enthusiastic about a new project. As soon as it reaches a certain stage of development, however, it is difficult to find further motivation to complete the project. This is not necessarily because I don&#8217;t enjoy it anymore, definitely not. I rather face the problem of having a new idea that looks more promising than the one I&#8217;m currently working on.

Well, there seems to be a simple solution for this problem: Limit your focus on a smaller amount of projects at the same time. Altough this advice seems kind of obvious and easy, following this advice certainly isn&#8217;t that easy. Sure, new ideas often seem to be very promising, but just don&#8217;t forget, that the ones you&#8217;re currently working on probably also did. I solve these issues by keeping track of my ideas using a classic, physical notebook. Whenever a new idea comes to my mind, I write down all of its details. After doing so, my mind can get rid of the idea and continue working on my current project. As soon as I consider this completed, I move on to the next one I&#8217;ve written down.

Although I don&#8217;t use this approach for very long, it seems to have a very positive effect. I don&#8217;t forget about cool ideas and I also keep my mind from focussing on too many things at the same time. Additionally, when there&#8217;s some time between the idea coming up and actually implementing it, the idea can be easier viewed from another perspective. Maybe it isn&#8217;t actually that great and you save yourself lots of time by not implementing it. Even if it covers a different context, I stumbled upon a [great article by mark manson on this topic](https://markmanson.net/fuck-yes).

## The Downsides

Chances are, limiting the projects you&#8217;re contributing to isn&#8217;t enough. There are times when the motivation to continue working on a project does not come by itself. It is therefore important to understand that motivation is not always self-evident. Eevery hobby, no matter how great, will suck on some days. And on these very days it is therefore important to pull yourself together and do your thing. [Here](http://blog.mjurtz.com/2017/10/self-organization-and-increasing-productivity/) is a link to this article that I published some time ago, in which I covered my way to build habits on things that aren&#8217;t that great. This can be also applied here. The goal is to be able to control your own motivation as well as to be disciplined so that you don&#8217;t just give up a personal project when it is not fun anymore.

The ideas are always great. Most of the implementation will be fun too, but don&#8217;t expect every single minute of it to be fun. In these moments, try not to think about how much this task sucks, try thinking about the result of it.

## Conclusion

Getting enthusiastic about a new project is easy. Thinking about about the implementation and design before jumping headfirst into it is something completely different. Always try to implement a project towards the planned MVP. Nothing is perfect and not everything will always be fun. You can help yourself by applying project management techniques to your personal project, as I mentioned in [this article](http://blog.mjurtz.com/2017/10/self-organization-and-increasing-productivity/). Concentrated working on a task is much easier with a well defined goal in mind.
