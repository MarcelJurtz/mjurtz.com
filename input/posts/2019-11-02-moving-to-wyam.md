It's been quiet for way too long here. I don't really have an excuse for my absence but I've been kind of busy, both personally and professionally. But I'm planning to post on here more frequently from now on.

As always, trying something new in software development helps to become motivated and excited. In the last months, I've been using Jekyll as a static site generator to build this site. Though I enjoyed using Jekyll, I never really got into the Ruby environment and have been looking for something more familiar.

A few weeks ago, I then stumbled upon [Wyam](https://wyam.io/), a configurable static site generator, which is based on .NET Core. I gave it a try and loved the simplicity, and now I migrated my blog to using it. I know it's not perfect yet, my search functionality for example is still missing, but that will also come back in a few days.

So, stay tuned for new content!
