  <h1>MacOS Package Management</h1>

  <p>The ability to work with the terminal under MacOS and use my familiar Linux workflow is awesome, but I have always missed a crucial component: a package manager.</p>
<p>Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS, according to the developers &ldquo;The missing package Manager for macOS (or Linux)&rdquo;. Today I would like to explain how you install and use Homebrew productively.</p>
<p>First of all: You can find the project&rsquo;s website <a href="https://brew.sh">here</a>, there you will find all the information and documentation you could wish for.</p>
<p>You might have to install the command line tools first. This can be done with the command xcode-select &ndash;install. If you already have Xcode or other software that needs the tools installed, you can skip this step. You can use xcode-select -p to check if the Command Line Tools are already installed.</p>
<p>To initialize the installation, use the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">/usr/bin/ruby -e <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Homebrew is based on Ruby, the version included in MacOS is sufficient for use, you don&rsquo;t need to install anything additional at this point.</p>
<p>Note: If you want to uninstall Homebrew, you can use the same command and replace the install at the end of the URL with uninstall.</p>
<p>You can use the <em>brew search</em> command to search for available packages. Without any additional parameters, all packages will be listed. This overview can also be found on the <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/">website</a>. If you want to search for a specific package, you can simply append your search term to the above command. Once you have found a package, you can retrieve information about it using <em>brew info [packagename]</em>. Alternatively, you can use <em>brew list</em> to display only the packages you have installed.</p>
<p>Packages can now be installed using <em>brew install [packagename]</em> and uninstalled using <em>brew uninstall [packagename]</em>. You can also uninstall packages using rm or remove besides uninstall.</p>
<p>You can already work with this state, but there are still no possibilities to update brew yourself, update package lists and update installed software.</p>
<p>The first is done with the <em>brew update</em> command. The command <em>brew upgrade</em> is then used to update the packages. This command updates all available packages. Alternatively, you can upgrade a single package using the <em>brew upgrade [packagename]</em> command. And by the way: <em>brew outdated</em> lists all obsolete packages. To exclude packages from the upgrade process, you can use the <em>brew pin [packagename]</em> command, or <em>brew unpin [packagename]</em> to undo this. Pinned packages are not updated automatically.</p>
<p>This should give you a good introduction to homebrew and make managing your software easier. You can also find a complete overview of the commands on the <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage">project website</a>.</p>
