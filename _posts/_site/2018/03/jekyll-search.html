<p>In one of my <a href="/2018/03/moving-to-jekyll">previous posts</a>, I went over the details why I moved my blog from WordPress to Jekyll. So far, I really appreciate my new system, but I miss one particular feature: searching through my posts.</p>

<p>Since Jekyll is a static site generator and does not rely on a database for the posts, you canâ€™t simply add a search functionality like WordPress does. So, I have to work with some frontend / clientside stuff.</p>

<p>After doing some research, I stumbled across <a href="https://lunrjs.com/">lunr.js</a>, a JavaScript-based text search library to use on the client side.</p>

<p>I decided to give lunr a try and went on to add a search box to my main page. You can now see this in the very bottom of the screen. The is constructed as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">"/search.html"</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">"get"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">"search_box"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Search Posts<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"search_box"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"query"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">"search"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When clicking the search-button, the user will be redirected to the <em>search.html</em> file. This site lists all matches and a search box containing the entered values. The search page consists of my regular header and footer. Also, of course, it contains a script which fetches all matching posts. It then lists all matches inside an unordered list. Of course, all scripts and pages are also located in this Blogs <a href="https://github.com/MarcelJurtz/blog.mjurtz.com">GitHub Repository</a>, feel free to check it out!</p>
