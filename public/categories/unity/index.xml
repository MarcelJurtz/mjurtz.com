      <description>ProBuilder allows you to bring more complex objects into your Unity scene without requiring in-depth knowledge of modeling programs such as Blender or Cinema4D. By now ProBuilder is integrated into Unity and can also be used free of charge in the Community Edition. In todays article I want to show you how you can integrate ProBuilder into your project and start modeling.
ProBuilder is not installed on your project by default, but you can add it via Window - Packages - All.</description>

      <description>Today I want to show you how to use a 360째 panorama picture as a skybox for Unity. As you may know, skyboxes are usually created from 6 images (cubemaps), with each image representing one of the sides. However, 360째 photos usually use a so-called &amp;ldquo;Equirectangular&amp;rdquo; format, which looks something like this:

So in order to be able to use such an image in Unity, the idea of creating a cubemap from a 360째 photo is obvious.</description>
