  <h1>Advanced Git - Git Reset</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-01-04T19:09:23Z class="post-date">Thu, Jan 4, 2018</time>
  <p>In <a href="https://blog.mjurtz.com/2017/09/getting-started-git/">one of my earliest posts</a>, I wrote an introduction to version control, more specifically: git. The topic I will cover today extends this article by a topic which is actually not that complicated. However, people seem to find it hard to deal with it and use it as a highway to StackOverflow.</p>
<p>I talk about <em>git reset</em>. This command can be used to reset changes in your working area or to remove staged files from the index. I think that one of the problems here is the context-dependent functionality of the command. Another problem is the commands potentially disruptive character, since it can lead to data loss.</p>
<h2 id="moving-the-current-branch">Moving the current Branch</h2>
<p>In general, you can split the commands functionality into two separate parts. First, the command will move the current branch. Let&rsquo;s look at an example. In my current project, I&rsquo;ve made some changes that I&rsquo;d like to reset. In my example, my current commit <strong>25a5d0e</strong> contains unwanted information and I&rsquo;d like to return back to the state at commit <strong>ea02e01</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a very simple example, git reset is not restricted to a single branch. I&rsquo;d also like to mention, that this operation will lead to commits that don&rsquo;t belong to any branch. In this case, git will automatically detect and delete them using its garbage collection mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="copy-files">Copy Files</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the reset command moves the current branch (which is actually a pointer to a specific commit). The second part of its functionality is to optionally copy contents from the repository to the index (also known as <em>staging area</em>) and the working area.</p>
<p>To specify where contents should be copied to, you can use the parameters <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>-hard</em></span>, <em>-mixed</em> or <em>-soft</em>. First of these copies the contents from the repository to both the index, and the working area. Appending <em>-mixed</em> will lead to the contents being copied only to the index, not to the working area. When using <em>git reset</em> without any parameters, this is what will be applied. The last option is to use <em>-soft</em>, which will prevent any content from being copied. In this case, only the branch-movement-part of the command will be executed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Working with <em>git reset</em> is easier than you think. Also, it&rsquo;s definitely helpful to always think of the two components. Doing so, there is another a really cool feature that you may already have seen: You can use <em>git reset</em> to unstage files. Alternatively to <em>git rm -cached</em>, you can use <em>git reset HEAD -mixed</em>, which will overwrite the staged files.</p>
