      <description>Some time ago I moved this website from WordPress to Jekyll, but I never really explained the reasons. That&amp;rsquo;s why I want to discuss in today&amp;rsquo;s post the option of managing websites using an offline CMS or Static Site Generator.
CMS like WordPress are often ridiculed and devalued by their complexity or their overall structure. In the meantime, there is a variety of similar content management systems available, but they usually share the core functionalities and structure.</description>

      <description>Hey, today just a short note on a few changes to my website.
Basically I planned to take up various topics in the area of software development and to capture my thoughts on this blog. However, as you may have noticed, I have published a lot about other subjects lately. I want to return to my roots on this site, so I decided to set up a separate blog. From now on you will only find posts on software development and related topics on this blog.</description>
