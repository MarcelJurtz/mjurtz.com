<p>Interfaces are one of the things I learnt very early when getting started with programming, but they are also something I did not use really often.</p>

<p>You probably know interfaces as “things that describe what other things can do” or as “contracts that specify functionality of a class”. While that’s correct, it does not cover why interfaces are really useful.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of using interfaces over concrete classes is the interchangeability of source code. To give you a quick example, let’s take a look at the definition of List<T>. This class implements eight interfaces, which are:</T></p>

<ul>
  <li>IList<T></T></li>
  <li>ICollection<T></T></li>
  <li>IEnumerable<T></T></li>
  <li>IEnumerable</li>
  <li>IList</li>
  <li>ICollection</li>
  <li>IReadOnlyList<T></T></li>
  <li>IReadOnlyCollection<T></T></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these interfaces provide different functionality to the *List<T>* class. If you want to iterate over a list of items, *IEnumerable<T>* covers that for you. So if you simply want to iterate over items in your application and don't need other functionalities like index based object access, you can simple use *IEnumerable<T>* instead of *List<T>*.</T></T></T></T></p>

<p>The decisive factor here is that *IEnumerable<T>* is not only implemented by *List<T>*, but by various other generic collections. So if you decide later on to use a *Stack<T>* instead of a *List<T>*, you only need to update your instantiation, the rest of your code will work without any changes.</T></T></T></T></p>

<p>This very simple example gives you a small insight into what’s possible by programming against an abstraction instead to a concrete class. The following sections will continue this thought and show some good practices &amp; common use cases of interfaces.</p>
