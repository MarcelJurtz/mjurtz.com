<p>After Kim Dotcom announced his new service, I just had to sign up for an invitation. After receiving it an hour later, I tried it out. In this article, I’ll document my experience with <a href="https://k.im/">k.im</a>.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I didn’t exactly know what I was getting into. After clicking the received URL, a very minimalistic website is displayed.</p>

<p>So, the service allows you to upload files. I never would have thought of that. But really, this service is different that what you’re used to. After clicking the <em>Upload File</em> Button, you’re prompted to enter a price, which will be required to pay for downloading your file. The default currency is displayed in USD. The value is automatically converted to Bits, which basically are Bitcoin units.</p>

<p>After confirming the value, you’ll have to enter some information about the file you just uploaded. This includes a header image, filetype description, title and textual description.</p>

<p>The process is almost completed now, but to be able to receive the money, you’re required to have a bitcache wallet. After creating a new one, you receive a welcome bonus of $10.</p>

<p>After completing all the required steps, you can select several platforms to upload your file. You’ll receive a link from where the file can be downloaded, like this one: <a href="https://k.im/1505667384189">https://k.im/1505667384189.</a></p>

<p>K.im and Bitcache look pretty interesting. Altough everything is still in a demo version, I think the approach is really interesting for people to market their stuff by themselves.
