      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about learning new things more efficiently, i.e. wasting as little time as possible on learning. I use the Feynman technique, named after the physicist Richard Feynman. Feynman was known for his ability to break down complex facts into their core message and to convey them very easily.
You certainly know the concept of being able to explain things to others in order to better understand them yourself. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m doing with my blog and that&amp;rsquo;s also the goal of the Feynman technique.</description>

In this post, I’d like to share my thoughts and experiences in learning new skilly.</description>

      <description>While being fun, programming is not easy. To be able to dive into a flow state in which you&amp;rsquo;re completely focussed on the topic, you need to cut off all distractions. With this article I would like to introduce you to my methods of working in a more focused manner and give you some tips that might make your life much easier. My experiences mostly come from the programming area, but the following tips can be extended to various other topics.</description>

      <description>In one of my earliest posts, I wrote an introduction to version control, more specifically: git. The topic I will cover today extends this article by a topic which is actually not that complicated. However, people seem to find it hard to deal with it and use it as a highway to StackOverflow.
I talk about git reset. This command can be used to reset changes in your working area or to remove staged files from the index.</description>

      <description>In order to get professional elements, side projects, sport and social contacts under one roof, I have recently been busy designing my daily schedule to maximize my productivity. this article presents the results of my reflections.
As a software developer it is almost self-evident to work on various own side projects, which in my case are currently mostly developed in the form of Android apps. Starting with an originally simple LifeCounter for Magic the Gathering, over smaller games up to the design of websites, my GitHub profile has meanwhile reached a considerable size.</description>
