      <description>As a developer you have probably already worked with Regular Expressions. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and didn&amp;rsquo;t need them too often, you probably googled them up more than you wrote them yourself.
So today I&amp;rsquo;d like to go through the basics of Regex and show you how to build regular expressions and how to write them yourself.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had anything to do with this topic before, this post is still for you, of course.</description>
