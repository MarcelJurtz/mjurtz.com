      <description>The term MVP - Minimum Viable Product is no longer a new word. The term was first coined by Frank Robinson in 2001 and is now used very frequently.
The basic idea of an MVP is to make a version of a product available to the customer as quickly as possible. The goal is not to generate sales, but to learn. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad idea and it&amp;rsquo;s also the intention to earn money with your product, but the idea here is to put yourself in the customer&amp;rsquo;s shoes and better understand their needs and requirements.</description>
