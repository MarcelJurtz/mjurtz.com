      <description>After Kim Dotcom announced his new service, I just had to sign up for an invitation. After receiving it an hour later, I tried it out. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll document my experience with k.im.
I have to admit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what I was getting into. After clicking the received URL, a very minimalistic website is displayed.
So, the service allows you to upload files. I never would have thought of that.</description>
