I think it's been in the middle of winter 2021/22, when I've been talking to a colleague of mine who mentioned a friend, that's been working remotely from somwhere sunny.
Sitting there in the cold, that idea sounded intriguing and always stuck with me.

But to be honest, that wasn't the first time the idea of working remotely, without any obligations to a specific locations appealed to me. I'm not sure when I first thought of this, but it's definitely been a while.

I think of myself as more of a summer person. I only realized this in the last few years, but the longish, foggy and wet winters in south germany really weren't my favourite time of the year - surprise. So, in summer 2022 I asked my teamlead if he'd be fine with me working remotely for some time during the upcoming winter. It should not be too big of an issue, I thought, especially since with the whole COVID-situation over the last years, the office was being used to stay halfway empty anyways. On the other hand, I didn't want to cut all the bridges and jump straight into cancelling my apartment - maybe this whole digital nomad thing sucks and I'd return back home after the glimpse of an eye.

So I decided to head somewhere south for a shorter duration of only four to eight weeks and see how everything works out. Right now, I'm two weeks into my trip and thought I'd take some notes on my findings - maybe it'll help someone else on here.

First of all - let's start with my motives, goals and requirements for the trip.

## Motives

There's a few different aspects about why I wanted to try this whole "digital nomad" thing. First of all, german winter sucks. Really. Especially right at lake constance (which usually is beautiful, no chance to deny that), november is completely foggy. There's days you leave the house in the dark, see nothing but fog and come back home in darkness again. That really isn't helpful for a good mood. And you also notice that on the mood of other people. Which again, does not help at all.

Also, let's be honest, who wouldn't trade in a few weeks or months of shit weather to a pair of shorts and more relaxed mentalities?

The next thing for me was simply about the option. I knew from previous experience that travelling anywhere, be it for work or pleasure, is kind of a jump into the unknown, but never did I regret jumping.So I figured, right now would be the perfect time to try it out. I had no obligations in germany that I couldn't handle via messenger, call or email and an employer who supported my plans.

Last but not least: As kind of an ambitious runner / triathlete I really dread winter training. All those layers of clothes, training in the dark, wet and cold really aren't that great. I'm not too big of a fan of cycling in general, even less when it comes to indoor cycling. But the worst part in germany (at least for my area) is the availability of pools for decent swim training.

## Goals & Requirements

Having mentally committed myself to spending a portion of the winter abroad, I needed good options to head out to. To figure out my options, I had two main areas when it comes to requirements for the trip: Criteria for work - and for training.

Figuring out where and how to get my work done was a breeze - I only need my laptop and reliable internet. The latter wouldn't even need to be very fast. The criteria to meet for my workouts on the other hand, were a bit more tricky. I needed options for swimming, biking and running, as well as strength training, eg. a gym. At least gyms can be tricky when it comes to short-term memberships, but pools also sometimes have the same restrictions.

## Heading to Gran Canaria

I knew I wanted to head south, since that would give me a bit more sun after work to get my workouts done in the warm AND to recharge on my vitamin D. In the recent years, I definitely noticed the lack thereof in the winter. That alone cut down my options to a few. Right now, I narrowed it down to portugal, mainland spain, the balearic islands and the canary islands. From there, I ultimately cut my decision down to the canary islands because of the mild climate (Mallorca gets kind of cold for cycling), the people over there but also the familiarity with the area in general. I knew that both Santa Cruz de Tenerife, as well as Las Palmas de Gran Canaria where pretty famous for working remotely, had good options for internet, accomodations and multicultural people to meet and exchange. I chose Las Palmas over Santa Cruz because I knew the city already and thought that'd help me to get along faster.

After having the destination settled, I started to research apartments and stuck with a regular AirBnb. Sometimes hosts offer discounts for long term stays, and this allowed me to find a very centrally located spot right at La Cicer / Las Canteras which would be fully equipped with kitchen, washer and WIFI. Las Palmas has a lot of coworking spaces you can rent, but I decided to try working from the apartment and move to an office for working if the flat wouldn't be enough. I booked the apartment and flights, including special luggage for my bike, and I was good to go.

## First Steps

Gran Canarias Airport is located in the middle of the island, right at the east coast. This means, that it takes a bit to go from there to Las Palmas, which is way up north. I was lucky to have friends of mine staying on the island at the same time, so I hitched a ride with the to the city. If you're taking the same trip, there's plenty of buses leaving from the airport so you'll be fine, but with a large bag AND the bike, a car is definitely helpful. Cabs are pretty cheap on the island as well, especially compared to the prices in germany, but it takes quite a while to get to the city so you'll end up with quite a big amount as well. If an option, just take the bus.

Since the island welcomes a lot of tourists each year, most people speak english. Or so I thought. While that's true for most of the younger people, the elder usually only speak spanish. So while you'll get along well with english, understanding basic spanish definitely helps. Anyway, fortunately my host spoke english and the checkin went fine. We headed out for dinner and my friends left again - sunday was done.

Next monday morning, it was time test my tech and see how working with only my laptop would work. I thought about buying a second screen here to work as I'm used to, but I figured to first try how everything would work out without it. And, to my surprise, I didn't really miss it, so I stuck with only one. Afterall, Win10s virtual Desktops are pretty handy.

Work in general felt like a breeze - WIFI was stable and fast enough to handle VPN, remote connections and video calls / screen sharing at the same time very well, so until now I also kept working from the apartment.

Trainingwise, I also jumped right in on monday evening. Las Palmas has a few bigger gyms that are pretty popular, the biggest one right by La Cicer, which was about 800m from my apartment. However, I decided to ditch the gym - and sign up for CrossFit. I had a few personal lessons back in 2020 / 2021, and I liked their approach to fitness in general. Also, I was just in my transition phase between two triathlon seasons so I thought, why not give that a shot. I could still head back into my regular gym-routine back home in germany after christmas. This would still give me plenty of time to try the sport and learn new movements, which I could also adapt later on in my actual base training phase which wouldn't start until mid december anyways.

So, after work I went straight to the box and signed up for six weeks, training four times a week.

Having my strength workouts planned, I needed to get the rest of my sessions organized. Running wouldn't be a problem, but biking and swimming needed some more coordination. As of writing this, I didn't go for a single bike ride - which is why I'll cover the topic in a second post. The week before leaving germany, I found out that the Gran Canaria Marathon was taking place right after my first two weeks of workation. After having run Chicago and Frankfurt the weeks before, I didn't really feel like competing, but I wanted to give the race a shot. I ran Gran Canaria back in 2019 as my first Marathon, even though that was in Las Palmas, this years Marathon would be in Maspalomas, right on the other side of the island in the south. So I mailed the race organizers and asked if they were in need for pacers for the marathon. I offered to run anything between three and four hours and they replied straightaway, asking me to pace the group targeting three and a half hours. This is why I decided to move the biking to after the marathon and focus on running, swimming and strength work for the first two weeks.

Getting to a pool was a bit of tricky as well. From my last visit, I knew that most pools required memberships to enter. However, I found out that there's at least two pools, that also offered single entries for non-members: Club Natacion de Las Palmas (next to Club Metropole, which does NOT offer this), and the Pool at Leon y Castillo in the north of the island / la isleta. I opted for club natacion, since it was closer to my apartment and situated outdoors. They also offer discounts for ten single entries at 10% off, so that might make sense for you as well.

## Reviewing the first Weeks

As of writing this, the first two weeks of the trip are already over. Besides the information I covered already, there's a few more things I'd like to mention on here.

* If you plan to work here, check out the "Live it up Las Palmas" - Community. They provide a Slack-Setup for digital nomads and likeminded people to share experiences and help each other out. Super friendly and very helpful for all kinds of questions, or just to meet up for all kinds of activities.
* Go surfing. While the south of Gran Canaria is popular for beginner surfers, the north is preferred by the intermediate because of the higher waves. But don't let that scare you. If you've never surfed before, get a few lessons and you'll be good to go after covering the basics with one of the great local teachers.
* Head out for Tapas: You won't have any issues shopping for groceries, theres a bunch of stores all over the city. Prices vary a lot depending on what you want, but especially fish and other local things are pretty cheap. But don't miss out on the local restaurants. Even if Las Canteras is pretty touristy, you'll find a bunch of great restaurants everywhere. But I guess I don't need to explain google maps for you :)
