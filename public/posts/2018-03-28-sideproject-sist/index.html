  <p>It&rsquo;s time to announce a new sideproject-launch!</p>
<p>Some days ago, I&rsquo;ve been looking for an app which allowed my to keep track of shopping lists in a simple and fast way. While there are lots of such apps available for Android, all I tested seemed to be overkill for what I really wanted. So I decided to create my own app for this purpose.</p>
<p>Besides creating a simple app, my goal was to learn something new while developing the app. I decided to use Androids built in SQLite database to store lists. I&rsquo;ve been using the database for previous projects, but I did not really care about the implementation. That being said, I wrote the queries all by hand which ended up being pretty messy.</p>
<p>In my defense I would like to say that I was still at the beginning of my programming career and had no idea of the existence of things like object relational mappers.</p>
<p>So I took a look around and decided to try Google&rsquo;s Room for Android. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with this project, feel free to checkout my article on the topic: <a href="/2018/02/introduction-to-room-for-android/">Introduction to Room for Android</a>.</p>
<p>The result of one weekend now meets my expectations: A simple Android app that fulfills the functionality I want. Multi-list management with individual entries and a focus on simplicity and speed. A small detail is for example the automatic expansion of the keyboard when adding new entries.</p>
<p>In addition to testing Room, I was able to try other Android features I hadn&rsquo;t used before. These include controls such as CardView or RecyclerView.</p>
<p>I would be very happy if you would test the app and submit feedback to me. As always, the entire source code is also available on GitHub and I&rsquo;m always available for criticism and suggestions for improvement.</p>
