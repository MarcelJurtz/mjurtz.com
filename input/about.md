Title: About Me
---

Hey, I’m Marcel. I’m glad that you found my blog, where I document my thoughts and write about everything that I'm interested in.

At the moment that includes mainly topics like software development with a focus on Android, C# and Xamarin, but also general related areas like encrypted communication or secure browsing. Regarding my topics in the area of software development I write about all sorts of subjects. From the introduction of a side project to a detailed description to a specific problems solution, you will find everything here.

In addition to these software-heavy topics, I am doing 3D printing as a hobby and I’m currently trying to build and consolidate CAD skills.

I’m quite easy to inspire which is why you will see several posts on here that are a little out of the ordinary.

Of course, I use different platforms to document and exchange the results of my work. I therefore refer to my GitHub profile, where I manage all my software projects, and my Thingiverse account, which I use to share 3D models.

I am looking forward to any feedback, please feel free to contact me via mail to marcel@mjurtz.com or Twitter: [@MarcelJurtz](https://twitter.com/MarcelJurtz). If you have any question or idea on how to improve this site, please also simply drop a message.
