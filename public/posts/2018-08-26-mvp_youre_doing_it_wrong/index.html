  <h1>Building an MVP - You are doing it wrong</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-08-26T06:00:00Z class="post-date">Sun, Aug 26, 2018</time>
  <p>The term MVP - Minimum Viable Product is no longer a new word. 
The term was first coined by Frank Robinson in 2001 and is now used very frequently.</p>
<p>The basic idea of an MVP is to make a version of a product available to the customer as quickly as possible. 
The goal is not to generate sales, but to learn. 
Of course it&rsquo;s not a bad idea and it&rsquo;s also the intention to earn money with your product, 
but the idea here is to put yourself in the customer&rsquo;s shoes and better understand their needs and requirements. 
This allows you to use early feedback and improve the quality of your product.</p>
<p>As you can see, the concept is very simple. But the problem arises during implementation. 
When we develop a product, we usually already have a fairly clear idea of what the final result should look like. 
To define how the associated MVP should look, we start cutting features at various points.</p>
<p>The result of this process is then certainly minimal, but is it also viable? 
Many teams forget this point and develop a prototype with limited functionality, which is simply not usable. 
As I mentioned in my article about [Scrum]({{site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-15-agile-get-started-with-scrum %}), the goal of every sprint is to add a working increment to the product. 
After each iteration the user should have a basic version of his product, enhanced by features of the last sprint.</p>
<p>The easiest way to illustrate this is with an example: 
If you want to sell a vehicle to someone, there are (in theory) different levels, each working standalone. 
From a scooter, a bicycle and a motorcycle to a car, each level has its own functionality that offers the customer added value. 
Also, each level adds features and functionality to the previous version.</p>
<p>The approach, which you might find in practice however, could look more like this: 
The customer receives the tires first, then the mounted underbody, through the body to the fully assembled car. 
So you can only really do something with the end product.</p>
<p>So when developing a prototype, keep the goal of adding value in mind. Updates should complement and improve the functionality, 
but the original product should already be usable.</p>
