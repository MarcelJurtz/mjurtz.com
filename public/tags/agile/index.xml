      <description>After I introduced Scrum in my last article, today will be about Kanban. Like Scrum, Kanban is an agile software development methodology and I have to say that I apply the principles I present today to most of my personal side projects.
Kanban is Japanese and can be translated as &amp;ldquo;billboard&amp;rdquo;. Kanban was first introduced by Toyota in the automotive industry and is now mostly associated with just-in-time concepts. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bore you with historical details, I want to show you the usage in software development.</description>

      <description>As a software developer you are certainly aware of Scrum. You may have already used Scrum or heard about it only marginally. With this article I would like to give you an overview of what Scrum is and how you can apply this methodology. Plus: You can also use many of the principles even for working on your side projects alone or in a small group.
Scrum is probably the best known process model of agile software development.</description>
