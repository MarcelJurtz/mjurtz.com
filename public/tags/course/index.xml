      <description>I have been asked all too often which programming language to learn first. And I&amp;rsquo;ve heard almost the same number of different opinions. Java or C++? Python or C#? Or maybe C?
High-level programming languages like Java offer the big advantage that the entry hurdle is very low. You can quickly put together a functional application that does what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do. The extensive ecosystem allows you to make rapid progress and concentrate on the functionality of your software.</description>
