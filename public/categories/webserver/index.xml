      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been starting a new blog on my domain, for which I wanted to use the &amp;lsquo;blog&amp;rsquo; subdomain. However, this subdomain was already in use for all my coding-related stuff. So, I decided to move my current blog from /blog to /coding and upload my new blog to /blog. So far, so good. Now I have both of my blogs up and running. There&amp;rsquo;s just one problem: Any incoming traffic to existing posts on my blog would resolve to 404s.</description>
