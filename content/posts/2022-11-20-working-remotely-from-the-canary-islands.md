I think it's been in the middle of winter 2021/22, when I've been talking to a colleague of mine who mentioned a friend, that's been working remotely from somwhere sunny.
Sitting there in the cold, that idea sounded intriguing and always stuck with me.

But to be honest, that wasn't the first time the idea of working remotely, without any obligations to a specific locations appealed to me. I'm not sure when I first thought of this, but it's definitely been a while.

I think of myself as more of a summer person. I only realized this in the last few years, but the longish, foggy and wet winters in south germany really weren't my favourite time of the year - surprise. So, in summer 2022 I asked my teamlead if he'd be fine with me working remotely for some time during the upcoming winter. It should not be too big of an issue, I thought, especially since with the whole COVID-situation over the last years, the office was being used to stay halfway empty anyways. On the other hand, I didn't want to cut all the bridges and jump straight into cancelling my apartment - maybe this whole digital nomad thing sucks and I'd return back home after the glimpse of an eye.

So I decided to head somewhere south for a shorter duration of only four to eight weeks and see how everything works out. Right now, I'm two weeks into my trip and thought I'd take some notes on my findings - maybe it'll help someone else on here.
