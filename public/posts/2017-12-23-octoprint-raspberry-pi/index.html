  <h1>Octoprint on a Raspberry Pi</h1>
  <time datetime=2017-12-23T15:44:40Z class="post-date">Sat, Dec 23, 2017</time>
  <p>Being tired of running back and forth to my 3D-printer to change stl files and starting / stopping prints, I decided to give <a href="https://octoprint.org/">Octoprint</a> a shot. Octoprint basically provides a webinterface for 3D-printers, which allows you to send tasks over your local network to the printer and to monitor the prints. The software also provides a plugin functionality, so you can create your custom addons if required.</p>
<p>Note that you can use Octoprint for slicing, but in my case I will be starting of with only sending pre sliced stl files to print.</p>
<h2 id="hardware--installation">Hardware &amp; Installation</h2>
<p>In this article, I cover the usage in combination with a Raspberry Pi. If you have a spare Raspberry Pi 3, I recommend using it, since it has built in WIFI. However, you can of course also use older versions with wired connection or by adding a WIFI adapter.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have anything installed on your pi, you can use <a href="https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi">OctoPi</a>, which is a preconfigured image which includes Octoprint. However, since I already have raspbian installed, I&rsquo;ll install Octoprint manually.</p>
<p>As you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Setup-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-running-Raspbian#basic-setup">installation guide</a>, you&rsquo;ll first need to install several packages for python. Of course, update your system first.</p>
<p><code>bash sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-setuptools python-virtualenv git libyaml-dev build-essential</code></p>
<p>As soon as this is done, clone the repository from GitHub and run the installation script.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cd OctoPrint
virtualenv venv
./venv/bin/pip install pip --upgrade
./venv/bin/python setup.py install
mkdir ~/.octoprint<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>

After installing, you might have to update user configuration:

<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>bash sudo usermod -a -G tty pi
sudo usermod -a -G dialout pi<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>

Now, you should be able to start the service:

<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>bash ~/OctoPrint/venv/bin/octoprint serve<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>

You should be able to connect to the web interface by using the pi<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s IP on port 5000. After your first connect, you&#39;</span>ll face an installation page. These steps are useful <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you want to setup custom slicing <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> octoprint. Since I slice my models in cura and send stl files to the printer, I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ll skip these steps.
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">## Customization
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">I currently don&#39;</span>t have a webcam <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> my pi, so I won<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t install webcam support. However, you can check out the instructions [here](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Setup-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-running-Raspbian#webcam) if you&#39;</span>d like to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> this.

I<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;d like to set up my installation to automatically start when the pi boots up. These steps are also covered in the [installation guide](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Setup-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-running-Raspbian#automatic-start-up), but I&#39;</span>ll wrap them up. Start by copying the init script and adjusting its privileges to be executable:

<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>bash sudo cp ~/OctoPrint/scripts/octoprint.init /etc/init.d/octoprint
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/octoprint
sudo cp ~/OctoPrint/scripts/octoprint.default /etc/default/octoprint<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>

Remove the comment-symbol <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#75715e">#) from the DAEMON-line in your ```bash /etc/default/octoprint``` file and add the script to your autostart with ```bash sudo update-rc.d octoprint defaults```.</span>

Besides having automatic startup enabled, you can now start, stop and monitor the octoprint service with <span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>bash sudo service octoprint <span style="color:#f92672">[</span>start / stop / restart / status<span style="color:#f92672">]</span><span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>.

<span style="color:#75715e">## Connecting to a 3D-Printer</span>

Well, that last step is quite simple. In my <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span>, my Anet A8 came with a USB type B cable which can be direcly plugged into the Raspberry Pi. And that<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s it. After connecting to the printer, you can&#39;</span>t just only upload files and print them, you<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;re also able to see the files available on the printers sd card and restart older jobs.
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">## Closing Thoughts
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">While that first introduction gave me some insights on what octoprint is capable of, but I&#39;</span>ve definitely barely scratched the surface. One cool thing <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> example is the built in API, which allows you to connect <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> example Android apps to monitor temperatures or to upload files.

All in all, I<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&#39;</span>ve had a great start with Octoprint and really recommend trying it out. Stay tuned <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> future updates!</code></pre></div>
