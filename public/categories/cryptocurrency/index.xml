      <description>What if there was a technology that could entirely change the basic elements of our society and our understanding of economy? This technology already exists and it is called crypto currency. Many people think of bitcoin when this buzzword comes up, but if you take a closer look, you will find out that the monetary point of view of the technology behind is only the tip of the iceberg.
Bitcoin and crypto currencies are currently a highly controversial issue.</description>

      <description>After Kim Dotcom announced his new service, I just had to sign up for an invitation. After receiving it an hour later, I tried it out. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll document my experience with k.im.
I have to admit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what I was getting into. After clicking the received URL, a very minimalistic website is displayed.
So, the service allows you to upload files. I never would have thought of that.</description>
